    <h2>RICHES BEGIN WITH THOUGHT</h2>
    <p>The dramatic story of big business that you have just finished is perfect illustration of the method by which desire can be transmuted into its physical equivalent!</p>
    <p style="text-indent: 35px;">That giant organization was created in the mind of one man. The plan by which the organization was provided with the steel mills that gave it financial stability was created in the mind of the same man. His faith, his desire, his imagination, his persistence were the real ingredients that went into United States Steel. The steel mills and equipment acquired by the corporation, after it had been brought into legal existence, were incidental. However, careful analysis reveals that the appraised value of the properties acquired by the corporation increased in value by an estimated $600 million [approximately $12 billion today]. The increase in value of the assets is attributable to the mere transaction that consolidated them under one management.</p>
    <p style="text-indent: 35px;">In other words, Charles M. Schwab's idea, plus the faith with which he conveyed it to the minds of J. P. Morgan and the others, was marketed for a profit of approximately $600 million. Not an insignificant sum for a single idea!</p>
    <p style="text-indent: 35px;">The United States Steel Corporation prospered and became one of the richest and most powerful corporations in America, employing thousands of people, developing new uses for steel, and opening new markets, thus proving that the $600 million in profit that the Schwab idea produced was earned.</p>
    <p style="text-indent: 35px;">Riches begin in the form of thought.</p>
    <p style="text-indent: 35px;">The amount is limited only by the person in whose mind the thought is into motion. Faith removes limitations! Remember this when you are ready to bargain with life for whatever it is that you ask as your price for having passed this way.</p>

    <h2>Commentary</h2>
    <p>In the years since that article appeared in the New York World- Telegram, the well-told business story has become its own genre within the publishing industry. There are bestselling books and biographies by and about the insiders who run every industry. The editors of this edition of Think and Grow Rich strongly encourage you to sample some of these books. They can be entertaining and inspirational, and in them you will be able to see examples of Hill's principles of success at work in the real world. And the best of them are not only entertaining and inspirational, but they are also filled with ideas and techniques you can adapt and use.</p>
    <p style="text-indent: 35px;">There are literally too many bestsellers from which to select a "best-of" listing for inclusion here. Any such choice the editors might make would not necessarily be the best but merely reflective of the interests of the person doing the choosing. However, there are two books the editors recommend that are not by or about a single individual or industry. These books are In Search of Excellence by Tom Peters and Breakthroughs! by P. R. Nayak and John M. Ketteringham. Each of these books deals with a broad spectrum of industries, and within each industry they single out certain companies and individuals for analysis. Both were published at the beginning of the business-book trend in the 1980s, but there are few books since then that better convey the importance of faith in a good idea. In Search of Excellence, chosen by a panel of experts as the most influential book of the past twenty years, was a runaway bestseller and will likely be in print for years to come. Breakthroughs! may be harder to find but it will be well worth the effort.</p>
