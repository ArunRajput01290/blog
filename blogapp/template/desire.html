        <p>Fill it out, concise statement of the amount of money you intent to acquire, name the time limit for its
            acquisition, state what you intend to give in return for the money , and describe clearly the plan through
            which you intend to accumulate it.</p>

        <p>Read your written statement aloud, twice daily. Read it once just before retiring at night, and read it once
            after arising in the morning. As you read, see and feel and believe yourself already in possession of the
            money.</p>
        <p>It is important that you follow the instructions in these six It is especially important that you observe and
            follow the instructions in the sixth step. You may complain that it is impossible for you to "see yourself
            in possession of money" before you actually have it. Here is where a burning desire will come to your aid.
            If you truly desire money so keenly that your desire is an obsession, you will have no difficulty in
            convincing yourself that you will acquire it. The object is to want money, and to become so determined to
            have it that you convince yourself you will have it.</p>
        <p>If you have not been schooled in the workings of the human mind, these instructions may appear impractical.
            It may help you to know that the information they convey was given to me by Andrew Carnegie, who made
            himself into one of the most successful men in American history. Carnegie began as an ordinary laborer in
            the steel mills, but managed, despite his humble beginning, to make these principles yield him a fortune of
            considerably more than $100 million [In today's terms, the value of Carnegie's fortune would be at least $20
            billion, and probably a good deal more].</p>
        <p>It may be of further help to know that the six steps were carefully scrutinized by the famed inventor and
            successful businessman, Thomas A. Edison. He gave his stamp of approval, saying they are essential for the
            accumulation of money, but also not only the steps
            for the attainment of any goal.</p>
